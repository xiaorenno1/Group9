Reading with children is a crucial part of their development. Parents and carers often read with children to encourage linguistic development, to promote healthy curiosity and imagination, and to introduce different aspects of the world. As children grow, they begin to engage in the process more actively, attempting to share in the reading and to ask and answer questions. Many children’s books facilitate this, for example, some books are tactile, encouraging children to interact with the pages, and some books have features such as lights and sounds.
与孩子一起阅读是他们发展的重要组成部分。父母和照顾者经常与孩子一起阅读，以鼓励孩子的语言发展，促进健康的好奇心和想象力，并介绍世界的不同方面。随着孩子的成长，他们开始更积极地参与这个过程，尝试分享阅读并提出和回答问题。许多儿童读物都促进了这一点，例如，有些书籍是触觉的，鼓励孩子与书页互动，有些 book 具有灯光和声音等功能。


The objective of this project is to develop a children’s book that is augmented via the use of a companion app. This companion app can interact with the children’s book in many possible ways. For example, you might consider an app that provides a “read along”, that provides additional information about the various pages, that brings the book to life using augmented/mixed reality, or which encourage the child to engage with the book without the aid of a parent or carer, for example through simple games.
该项目的目标是开发一本儿童读物，并通过使用配套应用程序进行增强。这个配套应用程序可以通过多种可能的方式与儿童读物进行交互。例如，你可以考虑一个提供“一起阅读”的应用，提供有关各个页面的其他信息，使用增强现实/混合现实使书籍栩栩如生，或者鼓励孩子在没有父母或看护人帮助的情况下参与书籍，例如通过简单的游戏。


A team working on this project will need to explore the moral and ethical considerations of such an app, including any legal frameworks which the app may be governed by. They should also research the way that apps can be used in an educational context, particularly with young children.
从事该项目的团队将需要探索此类应用程序的道德和伦理考虑，包括该应用程序可能受其约束的任何法律框架。他们还应该研究应用程序在教育环境中的使用方式，尤其是对于幼儿。
